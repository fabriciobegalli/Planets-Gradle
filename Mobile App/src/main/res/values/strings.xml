    <string name="europa_description_2">In Greek mythology, Europa was abducted by Zeus, who had taken the form of a spotless white bull to seduce her. She decorated the “bull” with flowers and rode on its back to Crete. Once in Crete, Zeus-who is a counterpart of the Roman god Jupiter-then transformed back to his original form and was seduced by Zeus. Europa as the queen of Crete and bore Zeus many children.\nFor centuries, the four largest moons of Jupiter didn\'t have actual names. Instead, Galileo gave each moon a number, from one through four. Of the four large moons, Europa was believed to be the second closest to Jupiter, which is why Galileo also called it Jupiter II.\n\nThe Galileo mission, launched by NASA in 1989, is responsible for much of the information we have on Jupiter and the bodies surrounding it. It took more than six years for the unmanned Galileo spacecraft to reach its destination. The craft stayed in orbit of Jupiter from December 8, 1995 until Sept. 21, 2003.\n\nA prominent feature of Europa is its high degree of reflectivity. Europa\'s icy crust gives it an albedo-light reflectivity—of 0.64, one of the highest of all of the moons in the entire solar system.\nScientists estimate that Europa’s surface is about 20 million to 180 million years old, which makes it fairly young.\nObserving pictures taken by the Galileo spacecraft, scientists believe Europa is made of silicate rock, and has an iron core and rocky mantle, much like the Earth does. Unlike the interior of Earth, however, the rocky interior of Europa is surrounded by a layer of ice that is approximately 62 miles (or 100 km) thick.</string>

    <string name="phobos_description_2">In the early 17th century, German astronomer Johannes Kepler proposed that Mars might host two moons, given that it lay between the Earth and Jupiter, which were known to have one and four satellites. No evidence of such moons could be found. Although most people thought that Mars had no moons, American astronomer Asaph Hall performed a methodical study from the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., searching closer to the planet than previous surveys.\n\nAfter searching without success, a frustrated Hall was about to give up but his wife, Angelina, urged him to continue. The next night, August 12, 1877, he discovered the moon that would later be known as Deimos. Six days later, he found Phobos as well. The two moons lay so close to their primary that they were hidden by the planet\'s glare. Asteroid-sized, they are also two of the smallest moons in the solar system, with the larger Phobos 7.24 times as massive as its companion, Deimos.</string>

    <string name="deimos_description_2">On August 12, 1877, the focused search for Martian moons by American astronomer Asaph Hall resulted in the discovery of Deimos. Six days later, he identified the second Martian moon, Phobos.\nThe existence of the moons had been suggested years before, when Johannes Kepler proposed that since Earth hosted one moon and Jupiter four (as only the Galilean moons were known at the time), Mars might have two moons in orbit around it. However, no signs of such moons existed until Hall undertook his careful search.\nUsing a 26-inch refractor at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., Hall made a methodical study of the region around the red planet. Peering closer to Mars than previous astronomers, he found Deimos circling only 14,576 miles (23,458 kilometers) from the center of the planet, traveling around its equator. Phobos orbited even closer in. Their close proximity and small size had kept them hidden in the glare from the planet.\nLike many objects in the solar system, the Martian moons take their names from Greek mythology. In Homer\'s ancient poem, \"The Iliad,\" Deimos (Flight) and Phobos (Fear) were the twin sons of Mars (Ares to the Greeks), and accompany him into battle.</string>

    <string name="sun_description">Age: 4.6 Billion Years\nType: Yellow Dwarf (G2V)\nDiameter: 1,392,684 km\nCircumference at Equator: 4,370,005.6 km\nMass: 1,989,100,000,000,000,000,000 billion kg (333,060 x Earth)\nSurface Temperature: 5500 °C</string>

    <string name="sun_description_2">One million Earths could fit inside the Sun. If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 960,000 would fit inside. On the other hand if these Earths were squished inside with no wasted space then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. The Suns surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth’s.\n\nEventually, the Sun will consume the Earth. When all the Hydrogen has been burned, the Sun will continue for about 130 million more years, burning Helium, during which time it will expand to the point that it will engulf Mercury and Venus and the Earth. At this stage it will have become a red giant.\n\nThe Sun will one day be about the size of Earth. After its red giant phase, the Sun will collapse, retaining its enormous mass, but containing the approximate volume of our planet. When this happens, it will be called a white dwarf.\n\nThe Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System. The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth. It is almost three quarters Hydrogen, whilst most of the remaining mass is Helium.\n\nThe Sun is an almost perfect sphere. There is only a 10 kilometre difference in its polar diameter compared to its equatorial diameter. Considering the vast expanse of the Sun, this means it is the closest thing to a perfect sphere that has been observed in nature.\n\nLight from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth. With a mean average distance of 150 million kilometres from Earth and with light travelling at 300,000 kilometres per second, dividing one by the other gives us an approximate time of 500 seconds, or eight minutes and 20 seconds. Although this energy reaches Earth in a few minutes, it will already have taken millions of years to travel from the Sun’s core to its surface.\n\nThe Sun travels at 220 kilometres per second. The Sun is 24,000–26,000 light years from the galactic centre and it takes the Sun 225-250 million years to complete an orbit of the centre of the Milky Way.\n\nThe distance from the Sun to Earth changes throughout the year. Because the Earth travels on an elliptical orbit around the Sun, the distance between the two bodies varies from 147 to 152 million kilometres. The distance between the Earth and the Sun is called an Astronomical Unit (AU).\n\nThe Sun is middle-aged. At around 4.5 billion years old, the Sun has already burned off about half of its store of Hydrogen. It has enough left to continue to burn Hydrogen for approximately another 5 billion years. The Sun is currently a type of star known as a Yellow Dwarf.\n\nThe Sun has a very strong magnetic field. Solar flares occur when magnetic energy is released by the Sun during magnetic storms, which we see as sunspots. In sunspots, the magnetic lines are twisted and they spin, much like a tornado would on Earth. The temperature inside the Sun can reach 15 million degrees Celsius.\n\nAt the Sun’s core, energy is generated by nuclear fusion, as Hydrogen converts to Helium. Because hot objects generally expand, the Sun would explode like a giant bomb if it weren’t for its enormous gravitational force.\n\nThe Sun generates solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles, which travels through the Solar System at approximately 450 kilometres per second. Solar wind occurs where the magnetic field of the Sun extends into space instead of following its surface.</string>

    <string name="mercury_description_2">A year in Mercury is just 88 days long. One day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km.\n\nMercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. One of five planets visible with the naked eye a, Mercury is just 4,879 Kilometres across its equator, compared with 12,742 Kilometres for the Earth.\n\nMercury is the second densest planet. Even though the planet is small, Mercury is very dense. Each cubic centimetre has a density of 5.4 grams, with only the Earth having a higher density. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock.\n\nMercury has wrinkles. As the iron core of the planet cooled and contracted, the surface of the planet became wrinkled. Scientist have named these wrinkles, Lobate Scarps. These Scarps can be up to a mile high and hundreds of miles long.</string>

    <string name="venus_sub_title_2">Facts</string>
    <string name="venus_description_2">A day on Venus lasts longer than a year: It takes 243 Earth days to make rotate once on its axis. The planet’s orbit around the Sun takes 225 Earth days, compared to the Earth’s 365.\n\nVenus is often called the Earth’s sister planet: Earth and Venus are very similar in size with only a 638 km difference in diameter, Venus having 81.5% of the Earth’s mass. Both also have a central core, a molten mantle and a crust.\n\nVenus rotates counter-clockwise: Also known as retrograde rotation. A possible reason might be a collision in the past with an asteroid or other object that caused the planet to alter its rotational path. It also differs from most other planets in our solar system by having no natural satellites.\n\nVenus is the second brightest object in the night sky: Only the Moon is brighter. With a magnitude of between -3.8 to -4.6 Venus is so bright it can be seen during daytime on a clear day.\n\nAtmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than the Earth’s: While its size and mass are similar to Earth, the small asteroids are crushed when entering its atmosphere, meaning no small craters lie on the surface of the planet. The pressure felt by a human on the surface would be equivalent to that experienced deep beneath the sea on Earth.\n\nVenus is also known as the Morning Star and the Evening Star: Early civilisations thought Venus was two different bodies, called Phosphorus and Hesperus by the Greeks, and Lucifer and Vesper by the Romans. This is because when its orbit around the Sun overtakes Earth’s orbit, it changes from being visible after sunset to being visible before sunrise. Mayan astronomers made detailed observations of Venus as early as 650 AD.\n\nVenus is the hottest planet in our solar system: The average surface temperature is 462 °C, and because Venus does not tilt on its axis, there is no seasonal variation. The dense atmosphere of around 96.5 percent carbon dioxide traps heat and causes a greenhouse effect.\n\nA detailed study of Venus is currently underway: In 2006, the Venus Express space shuttle was sent into orbit around Venus by the European Space Agency, and is sending back information about the planet. Originally planned to last five hundred Earth days, the mission has been extended several times. More than 1,000 volcanoes or volcanic centres larger than 20 km have been found on the surface of Venus.\n\nThe Russians sent the first mission to Venus: The Venera 1 space probe was launched in 1961, but lost contact with base. The USA also lost their first probe to Venus, Mariner 1, although Mariner 2 was able to take measurements of the planet in 1962. The Soviet Union’s Venera 3 was the first man-made craft to land on Venus in 1966.\n\nAt one point it was thought Venus might be a tropical paradise: The dense clouds of sulphuric acid surrounding Venus make it impossible to view its surface from outside its atmosphere. It was only when radio mapping was developed in the 1960s that scientists were able to observe and measure the extreme temperatures and hostile environment. It is thought Venus did once have oceans but these evaporated as the planets temperature increased.</string>

    <string name="earth_description_2">The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing: This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.\n\nThe Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe: Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted that the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it. Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus and this was eventually shown to be the case.\n\nEarth has a powerful magnetic field: This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This field protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.\n\nThere is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth: As a percentage of the size of the body it orbits, the Moon is the largest satellite of any planet in our solar system. In real terms, however, it is only the fifth largest natural satellite.\n\nEarth is the only planet not named after a god: The other seven planets in our solar system are all named after Roman gods or goddesses. Although only Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were named during ancient times, because they were visible to the naked eye, the Roman method of naming planets was retained after the discovery of Uranus and Neptune.\n\nOf all the planets in our solar system, the Earth has the greatest density: This varies according to the part of the planet; for example, the metallic core is denser than the crust. The average density of the Earth is approximately 5.52 grams per cubic centimetre.</string>

    <string name="mars_description_2" formatted="false">Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass: Even though Mars has only has 15% of the Earth’s volume and just over 10% of the Earth’s, around two thirds of the Earth’s surface is covered in water. Martian surface gravity is only 37% of Earth’s (meaning you could leap nearly three times higher on Mars).\n\nMars is home to the tallest mountain in the solar system. Olympus Mons, a shield volcano, is 21km high and 600km in diameter. Despite having formed over billions of years, evidence from volcanic lava flows is so recent many scientists believe it could still be active.\n\nOnly 16 missions to Mars have been successful. Including orbiters, landers and rovers there have been 39 missions to Mars, not including flybys or the attempt to return a sample of Phobos. Since the first, USSR’s Marsnik 1, was launched in 1960. Europe’s Exobiology on Mars program (scheduled launch 2016) plans to: search for possible traces of Martian life; study the surface environment; map potential hazards to manned missions in the future and begin preparations for an eventual return flight.\n\nMars has the largest dust storms in the solar system: They can last for months and cover the entire planet on. The seasons are extreme because its elliptical, oval-shaped orbital path around the sun is more elongated than most other planets in the solar system.\n\nOn Mars the Sun appears about half the size as it does on Earth: At the closest point to the Sun, the Martian southern hemisphere leans towards the Sun, causing a short, intensely hot summer, while the northern hemisphere endures a brief, cold winter: at its farthest point from the Sun, the Martian northern hemisphere leans towards the Sun, causing a long, mild summer, while the southern hemisphere endures a lengthy, cold winter.\n\nPieces of Mars have fallen to Earth: Scientists have found tiny traces of Martian atmosphere within meteorites violently ejected from Mars, then orbiting the solar system amongst galactic debris for millions of years, before crash landing on Earth. This allowed scientists to begin studying Mars prior to launching space missions.\n\nMars takes its name from the Roman god of war: The ancient Greeks called the planet Ares, after their god of war; the Romans then did likewise, associating the planet’s blood-red color with Mars, their own god of war.\n\nInterestingly, other ancient cultures also focused on color – to China’s astronomers it was ‘the fire star’, whilst Egyptian priests called on ‘Her Desher’, or ‘the red one’. The red color Mars is known for is due to the rock and dust covering its surface being rich in iron.</string>

    <string name="uranus_description_2" formatted="false">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and was the first planet to be discovered with the use of a telescope. Uranus’ most unique feature is that its axis sideways in comparison to other planets i.e. its north and south poles are in line with where other planets have their equators. Uranus is named after the Greek god of the sky.\n\nUranus was discovered by William Herschel on the 13th of March 1781 who initially believed it was a comet.\n\nWilliam Herschel tried to have his discovery named Georgian Sidus after King George III. The atmosphere of Uranus is composed mostly of Hydrogen and Helium with a small amount of Methane (H2, He and CH4).\n\nThere are several different pronunciations of Uranus the most common being “u-ra-nus” followed by “ur-unus”.\n\nOn the surface of Uranus gravity would be 89% of that on Earth (however as a gas planet with a liquid centre Uranus does not have definable surface).\n\nThe minimum atmospheric temperature of Uranus is -224°C making it the coldest planet in the solar system. Uranus’ moons are named after characters created by William Shakespeare and Alaxander Pope these include Oberon, Titania and Miranda.\n\nThe only spacecraft to visit Uranus is Voyager 2 which passed in 1986 passing at a distance of 81,500 km. Uranus has two sets of rings, nine inner rings and two outer rings.\n\nThe first set of rings was discovered in 1977 and the second set was discovered in 2003 by the Hubble Space Telescope.</string>

    <string name="neptune_description_2" formatted="false">Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the smallest of the gas giants. Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical prediction after unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus were observed. Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea.\n\nNeptune has only been passed by one spacecraft, Voyager 2 which flew by on the 25th of August 1989. Although smaller in diameter than Uranus, Neptune has a greater mass.</string>

    <string name="pluto_image">Image of Pluto</string>
    <string name="pluto_description">Gravity: 0.658 m/s squared\nDiscovered: February 18th, 1930\nDensity: 2.03 g/cm\ cubed\nCircumference: 4,494 miles (7,232 km)</string>
    <string name="pluto_description_2">Pluto is the only dwarf planet to once have been considered a major planet. Once thought of as the ninth planet and the one most distant from the sun, Pluto is now seen as one of the largest known members of the Kuiper Belt, a shadowy disk-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune populated by a trillion or more comets. Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006, a change widely thought of as a demotion that has attracted controversy and debate.\n\nAmerican astronomer Percival Lowell first caught hints of Pluto\'s existence in 1905 from odd deviations he observed in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus, suggesting that another world\'s gravity was tugging at them from beyond. He predicted its location in 1915, but died without finding it. Its discovery came in 1930 from Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory, based on predictions from Lowell and other astronomers.\n\nPluto is the only world named by an 11-year-old girl, Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, who suggested to her grandfather that it get its name from the Roman god of the underworld. Her grandfather then passed the name on to Lowell Observatory. The name also honors Percival Lowell, whose initials are the first two letters of Pluto.</string>
